# Basic-VLAN-and-DHCP-Server
In this practice, creating a simple network with VLAN and DHCP configuration. 

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a way to partition one physical network into several different virtual networks even though they are connected to the same switch.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol that allows a server to automatically assign IP configuration (IP address, subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices connected to the network. This differs from static IP address configuration which assigns IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS manually.
